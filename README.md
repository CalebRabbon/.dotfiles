# .dotfiles
## Installation of dotfiles
1. Go to ~/ or $HOME directory
2. git clone git@github.com:CalebRabbon/.dotfiles.git
3. Run the command stow .
## Notes
This will create symlinks in the user's ~/ or $HOME directory to the files in the ~/.dotfiles/ folder

The stow command by default will create the symlinks in the parent folder of the current directory you ran the command in.
